		        <h3>Lecture1/Course</h3>
				<p>We were introduced to the tutors and lecturers as per usual to easy everyone into the course. We got to see who we would be learning from in this course as well as details and intrests they all have.</p>
		        <p>We were also introduced to the 3 assignments we'd be doing in the course. We looked at webflow and customer journey maps but what intrestested me the most was learning to code on CMS, HTML and CSS. I did have a bit of knowledge on creating websites in HTML from another second year course so I was glad to be able to learn and practice more in Web Design.  </p>
	
				<h3>Ice Breakers</h3>
				<p>This was the first activiy we did in Figma. In order to get to know each other, we were tasked to design a name tag for our partner. On it we were to write, their name, what they are studying, hobbies and one place they would ike to visit </p>
			    <p>I was unable to attend this class as I have clashes on this day so I created one for myself and added it to the figma page for participation points hehe.</p>
				<p>I have inserted a snip of my name tag. </p>
				<p><em>To veiw everyone's work : <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/wGDvsea2plM84rIvng5uHH/Class-1---Ice-Breakers?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=n4Dc2txuSEk0XmSG-0/">Figma IceBreaker link here</a></em></p>

				<h3>Assignment 1 - Personas</h3>
				<p>We started off by doing a research report about who we wanted to create the webpage for. We needed to understand our users in order to help them reach their goal (while simultaneously reaching ours). </p>
			<p> In order to come up with a persona we needed to determin the goals of our website. We did this by creating a Venn diagram to see the over lapping goals between user and us the website dev. Both our needs must be met.</p>
			<p>We then created our user journey map. This discusses the emotions and pain points the user goes through. By using a user flow diagram it makes it easier to create steps that will be beneficial to the user and the way they navigate through their journey. </p>
		    <p>There was a inclass activity but due to clashes I wasn't able to join. </p>

				<h3>The first photo on WWW!</h3>
				<p>We then looked at the history of web design. The World wide web was created in 1990 with HTML tags arriving one year later in 1991. I found it interesting that A photo of a parody pop-group called Les Horribles
					Cernettes was the very first photo to be published. It was only 120px by 50 px which is mad! It's so crazy how much it has changed and developed in roughly 30 years! </p>

		<h3>First Coding Lecture</h3>
       <p>We also had our first coding lecture as well as a quiz to follow. We looked at the basics of HTML. I enjoyed this lecture because it showed us how to create a website from scratch by creating the files needed to get started such as the "index.html" file. We also learnt what different tags are and how they work(ie. if open they must be closed), and was introduced to headings</p>
<p>We also learnt two ways to add images. The first being by adding an image to a file then typing in code the image name. The second way is through a link from an online image.</p>

		<h3>Web History</h3>
<p>We did more web history. I was reminded that the first iPhone was created in 2007 which wasn't that long ago if you think about it. Even at the time it was able to surf the web with ease and had Safari web browser on it. I found it so amazing how we developed technology so quickly. 16 years later and we are now on iPhone15. Then again 15 years does seem so long ago but compare what we're able to achieve now with what we had back then is just so mind blowing to me.</p>

		<h3>"Skeumophoric</h3>
<p>I also learned of a new concept called "Skeuomorphic design". They are intended to help users understand how to use a new interface by allowing them to apply some prior knowledge about that precedent. I think this was cool as the internet and phones were such an alien thing at the time. Or some might say, "it was like magic".</p>
   </div>
  </div>	

<h3>Venn Diagrams</h3>
	<p>We then looked at Venn Diagrams and how we can set up our own as part of assignment 1. We were then given time to practice but yet again I could not attend as I had a clash and wasn't able to get out of it.</p>

	<h3>Coding Lecture 2</h3>
<p>We had our second coding lecture with more fundamentals of HTML followed by a quiz.</p>

		<h3>"User Flow"</h3>
	<p>This class we looked at User flow and Journey map. I was some what familiar with this concept so it wasn't too hard to follow along, however I wasn't sure how I would go about constructing one for my own website in assignment 1.</p>

			<h3>"User Flow Anatomy "</h3>
	<p>User flow was a little new to me, secifically the type of "boxes"/"nodes?" used. Each had a specific meaning so I had to learn what each meant and how to use them properly. There was a rectangle for "Display", diamond for "Decision" and circle for action. </p>

		<h3>"Making a start to final pdf file of assignment 1 "</h3>

			<h3>Lecture 6</h3>
<p>Today we looked at colour and typeface. We had a brief recap on colour looking at RGB values, CMYK and Pantone which was quite helpful. We also looked at hexidecimal and colour schemes like monochromatic schemes which use tones from the dsame angle on the colour wheel. There was also complementary schemes which are created by combining colours from the opposite sides of the colour wheel.</p>

			<h3>Lecture 6 - typography</h3>
			<p>Second part of todays lecture we looked at typography and typeface. We looked at how important it is and how it impacts our website and users. </p>
            <p>We also looked at font size where "px" is an absolute value, "rem" is multiple of the given size and "em" is multiple of the font-size of the element on which is used</p>

			<h3>"What looks good"</h3>
			<p>Type scale with fonts is very important as it changes the way we veiw and read text on websites. It makes it easier for us to read and interpret if done right. For example, having text go right across the screanis harder to read because our eyes have to track over longer distances. Its better to group them in smalled sections so that reading isn't so tiring. It also usually looks better in my opinion.</p>

		<h3>Assignment 2.1</h3>
		<p>We we introduced to assignment 2 where we needed to create a website prototype based off assignment 1. We needed to create wireframes and design iterations with a style guide and a final prototype.</p>

				<h3>Visual Hierarchy, Color, and Typography</h3>
				<p>Visual hierarchy, color, and typography are pivotal elements in web design that significantly impact user experience and the overall effectiveness of a website. Visual hierarchy guides users through content, ensuring that the most important information is prominent and easily accessible, ultimately improving usability. Color choices evoke emotions, set the tone, and help establish brand identity, making it essential to select colors that resonate with the target audience. Typography complements the design by enhancing readability and conveying the site's personality. A well-considered combination of these elements creates a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing design that engages users, communicates effectively, and fosters a memorable and enjoyable online experience.</p>

	<h3>More from lecture</h3>
	<p>We also looked at the importance ofbuttons and links and visual components we could add to our prototypes in figma. </p>
<p>After that we looked at the assignments and how to properly submit it which was helpful. I then began looking at other fitness websites for inspiration. Paying close attention to colour pallets and layout. I wanted to keep it minimal and easy to navigate since I sometimes fin it hard to get the information I need from a couple of websites. </p>
<p>I found that most fitness websites were dark and serious.</p>

				<h3>Lecture today!  </h3>
           <p>Today we went over the next assignment (assignment 2.20). Because there were two ways to go about doing this next assignment (in code or CMS), we were taken through both ways to give us an idea how we'd do the nxt assignment. Due to the amount of time given in this assignment I decided to go with CMS as I thought it would be quicker and easier. However I did'nt take into account that it might be harder since I had no idea what it was and had neve heard of it before taking his class.  </p>			
           <p>We also went over GitHub and GitHub Desktop for people who wanted to code as well as the finalassignment whic could be PDF or code depending on what you picked in 2.2. Because I picked CMS, I would need to code my blog which I'm currently doing now hehe.</p>
	       <p>It was important to pay attention when setting up GitHub bcause it was new tom this year. Although I had a little practice in another design course, I still wasn't comfortable with setting it up.</p>

          <p>I then worked ore on my assignment. At this point I had my wireframe done, style and was finalizing the prototype and iterations as I felt I didn't have many differences between the iterations I had. </p>			
       <p>I touched up on my style guide making sure to include all components. I did make changes towards the end when developing the final prototype so I needed to go through and make sure I had included all the changes made in the style guide.</p>

			<h3>Responsive Site</h3>
			<p>In todays lecture we looked at responsive design. We want our website to be able to be used and scale to the type of device we're using. This is tested through Device Emulation - we'd use developer tools to simulate different screen sizes and test designs adaptability.  </p>			
            <p>There was also Cross-Browser Testing: Where we check our designs on different browsers to ensure it is compatible.</p>
            <p>Lastly, there was Usability Testing : This is where you involve real users in testing to gather info and feedback on their user experience.</p>

		<h3>File Oranization</h3>
	   <p>It is important to name your files correctly but before actually starting to name them it's important to plan. We were toldto think of it as a digital workspace.</p>			
	   <p>We looked at types of images - SVG which can be vector, transparent or animated, PNG which can be raster, transparent, animated and lastly, JPG which can be raster and lossy. </p>
	<p>Naming consistency is also important when naming files. This helps find and keep them organized.</p>
	
   <p>Writing alt text, or alternative text, is a critical component of web accessibility and plays a signicant role in providing an inclusive user experience. Alt text is a concise textual description of an image, and it serves several essential purposes.</p>
